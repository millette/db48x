# Release notes

## Release 0.8.4 "Commands" - Optimizations and equation fixups

This release focuses on improving the solver support for the equation library, fixing various bugs found during development of that equation library, and optimizing the garbage collector.

### Features

* units: Implement non-proportional unit conversions, notably temperature
  conversions like `°F` to `°C`. The underlying engine allows arbitrary
  conversions, including non-linear ones, which would be useful for example for
  the Dalton temperature scale. However, that capability is not presently used.

* units: Convert temperatures to `K` in multiplication and division. For
  example, when computing `ⒸR*T`, we need the temperature `T` to be in `K` even
  if given in Celsius or Farenheit initially.

* solver: Report underlying evaluation error. For example, if the expression
  being evaluated reports `Inconsistent units`, this is what the solver will
  return instead of `No solution?`.

* Add configurable interval for busy cursor drawing, `BusyIndicatorRefresh`.
  The default is now 50ms, which refreshes the busy cursor more frequently than
  before, and may be detrimental to battery life and performance. You can
  restore the previous behaviour by setting a higher value, e.g. 1000ms.

* Automatic cleanup of temporaries to minimize the number of garbage collection
  occurences. When a complex operation such as `exp` is performed, there are a
  number of intermediate results that require storage, and were previously only
  cleaned up by the garbage collector. They are now automatically cleaned up
  before the function returns. The same optimization applies to intermediate
  graphics while rendering equations, notably on the stack. This delivers
  [significant performance improvements](#garbage-collector-performance) for
  long-running operations: the "[floating-point sum test](https://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-9750.html)
  is now about 20% faster on SwissMicros calculators.

* The `GCStats` command shows garbage collector statistics.

### Bug fixes

* Fix functions taking real-like unit input. For example, `atan(1_cm/1_m)` now
  computes correctly.

* solver: Do not solve system of equations using existing values. The multiple
  equation solver would incorrectly consider existing values in variables to
  check if an equation could be used for solving. The heuristic now picks up the
  equation that requires the smallest number of unknown variables among the
  available equations.

* Parse `x!` as factorial of `x` and not as a `x!` symbol. The incorrect parsing
  was due to an ambiguity in the HP48 parser that was resolved in the
  HP50G. DB48X now behaves like the HP50G and does not allow `!` to appear at
  the end of a name.

* Do not enter the debugger if `DebugOnError` is set while evaluating an `iferr`
  statement. The assumption is that if you try to catch an error, you do not
  intend to debug the code being tested for an error. If this is not the desired
  behaviour, then an explicit `DebugOnError` should be inserted in the body of
  `iferr`.

* Various unit-related fixes in the equation library.

* Ensure that we don't execute auto-completed catalog commands twice. The recent
  change that added the auto-completed command to the command-line history also
  caused the command to be executed on the command-line before being evaluated
  again from the key.

* Avoid a rare crash when an equation was too big to be rendered graphically and
  a garbage collection cycle occured between graphic rendering and text
  rendering.

* Do not emit error message from `Vec→` for vectors containing units. The
  incorrect error was introduced by the logic detecting polar, cylindrical or
  spherical vectors.

* Fixed `atan2` special cases to always generate the correct angle. Cases where
  `atan2` would generate an exact result would usually result in the wrong angle
  unit scaling being applied.

* Fixed parsing of `tan⁻¹` in expressions.

* units: Skip the `=Cycle` section for unit definitions. This was causing
  incorrect unit conversion errors for users who had added common units in the
  `=Cycle` section of their `config/units.csv` file.

* The user-defined units menu no longer list all the built-in units after the
  user-defined ones.


### Enhancements

* Major update to the documentation of the equation library, contributed by
  Jean Wilson.
* equations: Replace `°F` with `°C` in equations
* tests: Add support for tests that are known to fail (expected failures)
* tests: Run equation tests with `11 DIG`
* tests: Add ability to take screen snapshots on failure
* units: Put temperatures before pressure in `Fluids` section
* help: Add image for B Field From Finite Wire
* Makefile: When using `make update`, do not keep the temporary `.png`
* documentation: Indicate where to get `tac`
* documentation: Fix README link to browser version


## Release 0.8.3 "Blindness" - User mode and custom header

This release focuses on various user interface aspects.

### Features

* User mode, key assignment, `ASN`, `STOKEYS`, `RCLKEYS`, `DELKEYS`. Unlike HP
  calculators, key assignments are per directory, with inner directories
  inheriting the key assignments from the enclosing directories.
* Add `Header` command to customize the header. For example, you can now show
  the path in the header, or any relevant information. This customization can be
  done per-directory.
* Implement `Menu`, `TMenu` and `RclMenu` commands
* help: Automatically create links for references to RPL words.
  When we have `sin` in the Markdown file, the calculator will automatically
  insert a hyperlink to the corresponding entry. Note that this only applies to
  the calculator, not to the GitHub rendering of the Markdown files.
* Display object type in the `Info` box of the interactive stack.
* Fallback graphic rendering of objects to text when the usual heuristics did
  not allow the graphics to fit in the alloted pixel space. For example, a
  fraction that does not fit will now display using the textual form if that
  particular form can fit in the given box.

### Bug fixes

* Fix a bug that could cause the text editor cursor to move past the end of the
  editor when inserting text, possibly causing memory corruption.
* The `Show` command will now show all digits, and render fractions using
  multiple lines for the numerator and denominator so as to be able to show more
  digits in a readable way.
* When terminating a command using auto-completion in the `Catalog` feature, the
  command that was entered is now present in the command-line history.
* Arithmetic operations that combine text or lists and unit objects now behave
  correctly. For example, adding a unit to a list appends like any other object.
* directories: Move updir if evaluating an updir directory, instead of
  corrupting the directory stack.
* Clear transient object if entering the interactive stack, e.g. when exploring
  the interactive stack while in the `SolvingMenu` and solving an equation, and
  correctly update the transient object when switching menus.
* Render vectors as RPL code in the equation examples.
* Correctly redraw the text editor when using the interactive stack `Echo`
  feature with stack items spanning multiple lines
* Fix minor typos in the equations documentation.


### Improvements

* tests: Only evaluate after parsing RPL examples in the documentation when the
  stack is not empty
* The `Wait` command now returns a key code in the same style as HP calculators,
  i.e. with row, column and plane. Also, like HP calculators, it processes shift
  keys and returns a plane, instead of returning the keycode of the shift key.
* Capitalize `Path`, `CrDir`, `Home`, `UpDir` so that their rendering in
  compatibility mode with the `Cmd` setting looks better.
* Add `DB48X_SPEEDUP` environment variable support in the simulator.
* documentation: Update Authors section


## Release 0.8.2 "Honor Seats" - Equation Library Examples, Assignments

This release is focusing on the testing, validation and usability of the
equation library contributed by Jean Wilson. To that effect, it introduces a new
kind of objects, assignments, that only exist on the DB48x and have no direct
equivalent on original HP calculators. It also completes the support for library
equations in the `Root` command.

Here is an example that illustrates these capabilities, testing the
`Ohm’s Law & Power` equation in the library:

```rpl
V=240_V  I=32_A
@ Expecting [ R=7.5 Ω P=7 680. W ]
'ROOT(ⒺOhm’s Law & Power;[R;P];[1_Ω;1_W])'
```

If you are reading this release note directly on the calculator, you can simply
click `ENTER` while the text above shows up, and it will be copied in your
editor. You can change the values of the input variables to explore various
possibilities.

In this example, `V=24_V` is an assignment object that assigns the value `24_V`
to the global variable named `V`. It is almost equivalent to `24_V 'V' STO V`,
except that the value placed on the stack is the assignment object itself. In
other words, evaluating `V=24_V` places `V=24_V` on the stack. This makes it
easy to edit or evaluate assignments on the stack using the interactive
stack. In particular, you can select an assignment on the stack wiht the
interactive stack and use the `Eval` (F3) function to restore the variable to
the value in the assignment.

The `ROOT` command in the example illustrates how you can directly use equations
in the equation library as argument to `Root`, and use the multiple-equation
solver to solve for more than one variable at a time.

All the examples in the on-line help are now also tested automatically, in order
to ensure that all the given examples give the expected results.

### Features

* Implement `CustomMenu`, whicih is toggled by successive presses on the _VAR_
  key. An example is shown in the `Demo.48s` file. The content of the `CST` or
  `CustomMenu` variable is used to define this menu.
* The documentation now contains numerous executable examples.
  These examples are identified by a Markdown code block with the `rpl`
  syntax colorization indicator. They can be executed directly from the
  on-line help on the calculator by hitting ENTER while the code block is shown
  on the screen.
* The test suite automatically tests all the documentation examples.
* Two new equation sets, `Light Propagation` and `Ultrarelativistic Cases`
* Four new equations in `Energy & Momentum` equation set
* Assignment objects in the form `Name=Value`, e.g. `A=3`.
* The solver now emits assignment objects for the solution
* `▶` command to store while keeping value on stack. As an extension relative to
  the HP50G, this command also works inside RPL algebraic expressions.
  For example `3▶A` stores `3` in `A` and returns the value in `A`.
  The command is called `Copy` (the HP50G ARM calls it _▶ (Store)_)
* The `Root` command now accepts library equations as input.
* Arrays and lists are now accepted in algebraic expressions, using `;` as
  a separator between values. For example, `'[1;2;3]+[4;5;6]'` adds two vectors
  using an algebraic notation. Vectors can contain algebraic expressions. For
  example `'[x+1;y+2;z=3]'` is a valid vector expression.
* The solver now accepts algebraic input, including for the multiple equation
  solver using vectors as input.
* Ad `RombergPlot` example to Library and Demo file. This example shows how the
  `Integrate` command evaluates the underlying function.
* menus: Add `XRng` and `YRng` to the `PlotMenu`

### Bug fixes:

* Fix a sign bug in the `Simple Slope` equation
* Fix "Too many open files" error while saving constants, xlibs or equations
* Avoid infinite loop for unterminated `case` statement
* What follows a unit in an algebraic expression is no longer ignored.
  `'330_m-20_m'` was incorrectly interpreted as `'330_m'`, now is `'310_m'`.
* Fix and document the `Integrate` imprecision and iteration settings.
* text: Respect display settings in `→Str`. For example, `3 FIX 0.1 →Str` now
  returns `"0.100"` and not `"0.1"`, like on HP calculators
* Repair parsing of HP-style complex numbers, e.g. `(12;3)`
* Refactoring of object insertion in text editor to fix various bugs,
  including the `Echo` command in the interactive stack inserting the object at
  the end of the text editor instead of at the cursor position.
* Do not issue `Invalid digit for base` on the console parsing `1E-10`
* Fix null-dereference issue in `to_decimal_if_big`, which could be triggered if
  interrupting an `Integrate` command using the _EXIT_ key.
* Avoid occasional garbage at right of menu area
* simulator: Ensure Copy correctly quotes equations
* Move image for _E Field Finite Line_ to right section

### Improvements

* Add references to keyboard overlays in the documentation
* Add documentation for the `Root` command
* Improve the way we generate the image files in the Makefile
* Improve solver behaviour when a solution is not found. Notably, the solver is
  more likely to converge towards an extremum.

## Release 0.8.0 "Gabriel" - Symbolic operations, equations and library

This release adds symbolic integration, differentiation and equation
solving, delivers an extensive equation library, and improves the
library feature to enable large library objects to be defined in
separate files and optimize execution speed for library items.
It also improves the rendering of complex equations and fixes a number
of crashes or user-interface problems.

### Features

* Symbolic integration, `Primitive` command, `'∫X(sin(X))'` syntax
  `'∫X(sin(2*X+3)-X)'` evaluates as `'-cos(2*X+3)/2-x²/2'`
* Symbolic differentiation, `Derivative` command, `∂X(sin(X))` syntax
  `'∂X(sin(2*X+3)-X)'` evaluates as `'2·cos(2*X+3)-1'`
* Symbolic equation resolution, `ISOL` (`Isolate`) command
  '`sin(2*X+3)=A' 'X' ISOL` gives `'X=(sin⁻¹ A+2*i1*π-3)/2'`
* Apply arithmetic and functions on both sides of equations like `A=B`
  `'A=B' sin 1 +` results in `'sin A+1=sin B+1'`
* Add possibility to define library objects in separate files
  The various demos from previous releases are now also in the library
* commands: Add `→Prog` command to convert expressions to RPL programs
  `'sin(2*X-Y)' →Prog` gives `« 2 X × Y - sin »`
* Accelerate evaluation of library entries
  Invoking a library object is as fast as if it was on the stack.
  Notice that this is faster than global objects that require lookup.
* Add ``Obj→` support for user-defined function calls
  `'F(A;B;C)' Obj→ DROP Obj→ ` gives `[F A B C]`.
  The first call to `Obj→` expands the expression, leaving an isolated
  function call on the stack, which the second `Obj→` expands.
* Automatically convert polynomial objects to expressions when needed
* Many improvements to the equation library contributed by Jean Wilson
* Document the equation library variables in the help file
* Add classical/relativistic Kinetic Energy comparison demo
  This was suggested by Jean Wilson as an illustration
* parser: Parse and convert HP syntax for `|`
  Typing `'A(X;Y)|(X=1;Y=2)'` converts to `'A(X;Y)|X=1|Y=2'`

### Bug fixes

* Improve graphical rendering of some complex expressions
* Render `sqrt` as `√` and not `squareroot` in HP compatibility mode
* Do not draw parentheses around `|x|` when rendering `abs`

## Release 0.7.14 "Kids" - Equation-related bug fixes

This release fixes a number of issues that were discovered primarily through the
Columns and Beams equations.


### Features

* trigonometrics: Add conversion from non-standard angles, so that `cos(1_turn)`
  gives the correct result.
* debug: Debug on error with `DebugOnError` and `KillOnError` settings. This
  makes it easier to debug an RPL program, by making it possible to single-step
  around the instruction that generated the error.
* tests: Add three 30 second demo of DB48X features. These are to generate
  marketing videos for the iPhone version on the Apple store (to be done).


### Bug fixes:

* ui: Keep a GC pointer in `draw_object` to avoid a memory crash
* equations: Add missing units in some equations, e.g. `I` and `A` in second
  equation of Coilumns and Beams
* equations: Add explicit `radian` unit in Eccentric Columns `cos`, which
  ensures we get the correct result from the HP50G manual even when in Degrees
  mode.
* units: Correctly factor out non-integral powers, so that we can compute
  `1/sqrt(epsilon_0*mu_0)` and get the correct result.
* catalog: Display commands that begin with selection first, so that `FORE`
  shows `Foreground` before `AlphaForeground`.
* stats: When computing a sum, evaluate the expression on all terms. The result
  for `Variance` with single variables was wrong because the first term was
  computed incorrectly due to a misguided optimization.
* graphics: Error out in `RGBPattern` for negative input. The negative values
  were generating an error, but it was not reported, so the next command was
  likely to report it.
* help: Render shift keys correctly in the color version. The bitmap was
  interpreted as containing color data. Colorize it instead.

### Improvement

* ui: Select orange as background color during search. The previous setting of
  showing seardch using white foreground on a white background was probably
  pushing the notion of "blind search" a bit too far.


## Release 0.7.13 "Murderers" - Solver improvements

## Release 0.7.11 "Rest" - Refine interactive stack, graphics in help

This release is a refinement minor release. The primary focus is the interactive
stack, which now lets you edit items, sort either according to memory
representation or by value, display information about objects, and jump directly
to a given stack level using digits.

The simple random number generator implemented in 0.7.10 was replaced with an
additive congruential random number generator (ACORN), which can be configured
in number of bits and number of iterations. A side effect is that there is now
regression testing for single-variable statistics.

The history feature was also improved by automatically enabling the `EditMenu`
when selecting history, and then having the (unshifted) word left and word right
commands automatically cycle through history if used at beginning or end of the
editing buffer.

### Features

* help: Add ability to display BMP images in help files
* images: Convert help images to BMP

## Release 0.7.5 "Perfect Joy" - Polynomials and symbolic rewrites

This release contains a lot of groundwork in preparation for future work on
symbolic expressions, symbolic solving and symbolic integration, as well as to
improve compatibility with HP calculators. In particular, `rewrite` has been
replaced with the HP equivalents, `↑Match` and `↓Match`, allowing top-down and
bottom-up replacement, as well as support for conditions. Also, these commands
return the number of replacements performed instead of just `0` or `1`.

THe other major user-visible new feature is the addition of a polynomials data
type, which does not exist on HP calculators, exposing polynomial features in a
way that is more consistent with the spirit of RPL. For example, Euclidean
division of polynomials can be achieved using the regular `/` operation on
polynomials instead of requiring a dedicated `DIV2` command.

## Release 0.7.2 "Light" - Libraries, Characters menu

This release introduces four relatively significant features:

1. An Equation Library
2. A more general Library
3. Character menus
4. A character modification catalog

There are also a number of bug fixes and improvements.


### Features

* The *Equation Library* is similar in principle to what is found in the HP50G.
  It is intended to store equations covering a variety of topics.
  The Equation Library is accessible using the _EQS_ key (🟦 _'()'_).
  It is presently only very sparsely populated, but a future release should
  add the equations listed in Chapter 5 of the *HP50G Advanced User's Reference
  Manual*. Elements of the Equation Library appear as named *Equation Objects*.
  The Equation Library is configured by file `config/equations.csv`.

* The *Library* is similar to the Equation Library, but for all kinds of objects
  such as programs or code snippets. The Library is accessible using the _LIB_
  key (🟦 _VAR_). It can be used to customize your calculator, and is intended
  to play the roles of the `CST` variable (quick access to common features)
  and Library Objects / XLIB (external extensions to RPL). Elements of the
  Library appear as named *Library Objects*.
  The Library is configured by file `config/library.csv`.

* The *Characters Menu* lets you enter Unicode characters easily, by presenting
  various classes of characters, such as `RPL`, `Greek` or `Punct`.
  The Characters Menus is accessible using the _CHAR_ key (🟦 _2_).
  It can be used to enter international characters (e.g. Greek or Cyrillic), as
  well as special characters such as arrows or blocks.
  The Characters Menu is configured by file `config/characters.csv`.

* The *Characters Catalog* appears when the `Catalog` is active and the cursor
  is inside some text object. It gives you access to characters that are
  visually close to the character on the left of the cursor. For example, after
  typing `A`, the presented choices include `À`, `a` or `α`.
  The Characters Catalog is configured by file `config/characters.csv`.

* compare: Add comparisons for `true` and `false` values

* Add `TEVAL` command (timed evaluation)


### Bug fixes

* Do not add unnecessary parentheses in ratios, e.g. `(A+B)/(X-Y)`
* Make sure we can save back the configuration files correctly
* Improve access path checks to accept `config:constants.csv`.
* Avoid syntax error in `1/(1+x)` due to `1/` being seen as a fraction
* unitfile: Remove slight risk of bad menu display after garbage collection
* date/time: Make sure we save the stack and last args for `Date`, `Time`, ...
* parser: Skip spacing when parsing numbers (to parse back `→Text` result)
* time: Fix rendering of DMS time in lists, matrices, vectors
* catalog: Fix a subtle bug on DM32 leading to a crash using the catalog


### Improvements

* constants: Get values of special `π` and `e` by name
* constants: Add prefix in editor to identify constants, equations and xlib
* constants: Represent constants with an index for memory and performance
* constants: Parse units containing text
* constants: Allow `RCL` to recall a constant value
* units: Direct insertion of units after numbers
* menu: Update `Roll` and `RollDown` menu entries
* show: Show all decimals for decimal values
* help: Display the correct on-line help topic for constants
* catalog: Use less memory for the sorted IDs
* integrate: Use numerical computations for faster convergence
* locals: Improve error message for bad locals
* graph: Improve graphical rendering of constants (bold) and equations
* graph: Do not add unnecessary parentheses in ratios
* tests: Add tests for characters menu/catalog
* tests: Fix the `.` vs `0.` test
* ui: Do not enter DMS inside text
* tests: Display disabled tests in gray
* catalog: Keep a single spelling, e.g. no `add` duplicates

## Release 0.7.1 "Whip" - Bug fixes

Inserting variables, constants or units in a program was broken.
Also a few less critical fixes.

### Bug fixes

* decimal: Apply `MinimumSignificantDigits` to `Sig` modes
* tests: Fix missing `]` at end of vector
* ui: Insert commands for unit conversions, constants and variables
* tests: Adjust help screen snapshot for authors
* menus: Do not clip text for hierarchical menus
* constants: Do not use units that don't parse correctly
* dmcp: Day of week convention adjustment

## Release 0.7.0 "Temple" - Graphics Equation Rendering

This release introduces a few major improvements, including graphical
rendering of equations and matrices, the `Show` command to display
large objects full-screen, customizable constants, and date-related
operations.

### New features

* Graphical rendering of equations, fractions, matrices, vectors and
  lists. In graphical rendering mode, variables are showin in italics.
* Constants in the `ConstantsMenu`, split into categories, and loading
  from an optional `config/constants.csv` file, in a way
  similar to what existed for units.
* Inverse trigonometric functions (`asin`, `acos` and `atan`) now
  produce unit objects with the current angle mode as a unit. This can
  be configured by the `SetAngleUnits` / `NoAngleUnits` flags.
* `Cycle` (_×10ⁿ_ key) now cycles between angle units.
* `R→D` and `D→R` commands to convert between degree and radian in a
  purely numerical way (no unit). This is for compatibility with HP.
* Add `→Deg`, `→Rad`, `→Grad`, `→πr` commands, which convert a number
  to the target unit using current angle mode, and convert an angle to
  the target angle unit.
* Conversion from DMS to HMS and from HMS to DMS
* Rendering of dates: `19681205_date` renders as `Fri 5/Dec/1968`,
  with a format configuration using the same flags as for the header.
  Note that the date format is `YYYYMMDD`, _not_ the same as on HP
  calculators. This allows `YYYYMMDD.hhmmss` for dates with time.
* `Date` and `Time` command to return the current date and time.
  Additionally, `DateTime` returns both date and time, and
  `ChronoTime` returns the time with 1/100s precision.
* `→Date` and `→Time` commands to set the system date and time
* `Date+`, `DDays` and date arithmetic using `+` or `-`, using day
  units for the results. As an extension relative to HP calculators,
  these will accept fractional days, or other time units. For example,
  adding `1000000_s` to `19681205_date` generates a date with time
  result, `Tue 16/Dec/1968, 13:46:40`
* `JulianDayNumber` and `DateFromJulianDayNumber` commands to convert
  between dates and Julian day numbers. These commands also accept
  fractional input.
* `Show` command showing a full-screen graphical rendering of the
  result on the stack. The resut is size-adjusted. For example, you
  can display all digits in `200!`. If the result does not fit on the
  screen, you can scroll using the _◀︎_ and _▶︎_, as well as _8_, _6_,
  _4_ and _2_. The maximum pixel size for `Show` is set by `MaxW`
  (default is the width of the LCD), the maximum height is set by
  `MaxH` (default is 2048 pixels).
* `AutoScaleStack` and `NoAutoScaleStack` settings to automatically
  adjust the font size for the stack elements.
* Support for system flags -20 to -26 (infinite results, overflow and
  underflow).


### Bug fixes

* simulator: Adjust DMCP month off-by-one error
* Repair insertion of `while` loops and similar commands on the
  command line
* Use stack format when drawing an object with `DrawText` (`DISP`)
* Arithmetic on unit objects no longer auto-simplifies, e.g.
  `1_s 1_s -` returns `0_s` and not `0`.
* Perform computations for `→Q` using integer values, which avoids an
  issue where increasing the number of iterations with an unachievable
  precision could prodduce `1/1` as the fractional result.
* Repair auto-simplification for `i*i=-1`
* Display a negative mixed fraction as `-1 1/3` and not `1 -1/3`.
* Do not insert `()` after a multiplication in algebraic mode
* Accept units and tagged objects in `PolarToReal` and `RealToPolar`
* Accept angle units as input for `→DMS`
* Off-by-one clipping error in header, erasing the shift annunciator
* Fix help for `FC?` (incorrectly stating that it tested for flat set)
* Lookup units and constants in a case sensitive way
* Fix labels for `ExpFit` and `LinFit` in `RegressionMenu`.


### Improvements

* tests: Adjust tests to match bugs fixed in v0.6.5
* dms: Accept entering minutes without third dot, e.g. `1.2.3 ENTER`
* menus: Split the Time, Date and Alarm menus
* Split rendered objects at space boundaries. This notably ensures
  that large numbers are split at digit grouping boundaries, and makes
  it possible to display larger programs on the stack. The rendering
  of programs and matrices/vectors/lists has also been fine-tuned.
* The "white circle" glyph has a thicker border, makes it more
  readable in menus.
* doc: Update the list of unimplemented features
* menus: Draw a white circle for disabled flags, and allow the menu
  function to toggle the flag. This made it possible to reduce the
  number of menu entries for flag-heavy menus.
* Mixed fractions are now the default, as opposed to improper
  fractions
* doc: Improve the quickstart guide
* doc: Improve the documentation for sin, cos and tan
* tests: Make it possible to interrupt a running test
* help: Skip HTML tags, e.g. <video>
* simulator: Add screenshot capability, and reduce window height
* menus: `ToolsMenu` selects time, date or angle menu based on units


## Release 0.6.5 "Testimony": Small bug fixes

This release does not contain much because FOSDEM took a lot of energy.

## New features

* menu: Connect `ceil` and `floor` functions
* Add real to polar conversions
* units: Add `dms` unit to angles menu

## Bug fixes

* decimal: Compute `ln(0.002)` correctly
* integer: Do not parse degree sign if in a complex
* units: Fix parsing of angle units
* font: Add radian glyph


## Release 0.6.4 "Healing": Testing and fixes

This release focuses on heavy testing of the new variable-precision
decimal stack. Adding tests also means finding bugs.

Another significant change is support for fixed-precision
hardware-accelerated floating point, using 32-bit and 64-bit IEEE754
binary floating-point representation. Since this uses a binary format,
some decimal values do not map to decimal correctly. For example,
displaying 1.2 with a large number of decimals will show residue,
because 1.2 does not have an exact (zero-terminated) representation in
binary.

### New features:

* plotting: Make refresh rate configurable
* menu: Add `/` key to `FractionsMenu`
* hwfp: Add support for hardware-accelerated floating-point
* menus: Add hardware floating-point flag to `MathModesMenu`

* ui: Make sure we save stack if closing the editor
* logical: Fix mask for rotate left with 64-bit size
* logical: Make sure we save args for single-argument logicals
* flags: Update flags on `FlipFlag`, consume them from `BinaryToFlags`
* stack: Show multi-line objects correctly
* lists: Returns `Bad argument value` for index with bad arguments
* lists: Return an empty list for tail of empty list
* arithmetic: `→Frac` should not error on integers
* power: Do not shut down during `WAIT` if on USB power

### Improvements:

## Release 0.6.0 "Christmas": Introducing variable precision

This release was a bit longer in coming than earlier ones, because we are about
to reach the limits of what can fit on a DM42. This release uses 711228 bytes
out of the 716800 (99.2%).

Without the Intel Decimal Library code, we use only 282980 bytes. This means
that the Intel Decimal Library code uses 60.2% of the total code space. Being
able to move further requires a rather radical rethinking of the project, where
we replace the Intel Decimal Library with size-optimized decimal code.

As a result, release 0.6.0 introduces a new table-free and variable-precision
implementation of decimal computations. In this release, most operations are
implemented, but some features are still missing (e.g. Gamma function). This
release will be simultaneous with 0.5.2, which is functionally equivalent but
still uses the Intel Decimal library. The new implementation is much more
compact, allowing us to return to normal optimizations for the DM42 and regain
some of the lost performance. On the other hand, having to switch to a table
free implementation means that it's significantly slower than the Intel Decimal
Library. The upside of course is that you can compute with decimal numbers that
have up to 9999 digits, and a decimal exponent that can be up to 2^60
(1 152 921 504 606 846 976).


### New features

Variable precision decimal floating point implementation for arithmetic,
trigonometrics, logs, exponential and integer factorial. Other functions may
still return "unimplemented error".

### Bug fixes

None. If anything, this release introduces bugs in computations and performance
regressions. However, it frees *a lot* of space for further DM42 development.

### Improvements

The `Precision` setting now sets the number of digits with a granularity of one,
between 3 and 9999. Ideal use of memory is with multiples of 12 digits, e.g. 12,
24 or 36 digits, where decimal packing does not cause lost bits.

Performance on the DM42 is somewhat improved, since it is now possible to return
to a higher level of optimization.

### Regressions

In addition to lower performance and unimplemented functions, this version no
longer builds a compatible QSPI. This means that returning to the DM42 requires
flashing *both* the QSPI and the PGM file.


## Release 0.5.2 "Christmas Eve": Reaching hard limits on the DM42

This release was a bit longer in coming than earlier ones, because we are about
to reach the limits of what can fit on a DM42. This release uses 711228 bytes
out of the 716800 (99.2%).

Without the Intel Decimal Library code, we use only 282980 bytes. This means
that the Intel Decimal Library code uses 60.2% of the total code space. Being
able to move further requires a rather radical rethinking of the project, where
we replace the Intel Decimal Library with size-optimized decimal code.

As a result, release 0.5.2 will be the last one using the Intel Decimal Library,
and is release in parallel with 0.6.0, which switches to a table-free and
variable-precisions implementation of decimal code that uses much less code
space. The two releases should otherwise be functionally identical
